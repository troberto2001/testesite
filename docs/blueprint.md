## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Luxurious Yellow (#FFD700) to convey elegance and professionalism.
- Background color: Desaturated light yellow (#FAF9F0) to provide a subtle contrast and enhance readability.
- Accent color: Golden yellow (#FFC107) for CTAs and highlights, drawing attention to important elements.
- Font: 'Alegreya', a serif font for headings, to project an elegant, intellectual, contemporary feel. For body text also use 'Alegreya' as it is easily readable for long-form paragraphs
- Use minimalist, sophisticated icons related to roofing and cleaning services, ensuring they complement the luxury theme.
- Employ a clean, modern layout with ample white space to provide an uncluttered and sophisticated look. Sections should be clearly delineated, and elements should be well-aligned for ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle animations, such as fade-in effects on scrolling or gentle transitions on hover, to enhance the user experience without being distracting.
